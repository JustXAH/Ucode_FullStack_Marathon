    <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 PC game review by GSMArena.com</h1>

        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the latest title from Polish game studio
            CD Projekt Red, the same company that brought us the successful
            Witcher series. Announced first in 2012, Cyberpunk 2077 went through
            multiple delays before it was finally launched on December 10 on
            Windows, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia.</p>
        <p>It would be an understatement to say that Cyberpunk 2077 was one of
            the most hyped game launches in recent memory. While the initial
            announcement did happen in 2012, it wasn't until the developers
            showcased the game at E3 2018 when it suddenly exploded in
            popularity. Then last year, the studio announced that Keanu Reeves
            would be part of the game. Reeves appeared on stage during the Xbox
            E3 2019 event and ended up giving us one of the best memes of 2019.
            The game also finally got a launch date - April 16, 2020.</p>
        <p>Since then, the hype train had been going full speed until it
            reached its first major hitch in January of this year when CDPR
            announced that they won't be making their April deadline and
            instead will be releasing the game on September 17. They said
            the game was complete but needed more time to polish. Then in
            June the release date was pushed back further, this time to
            November 19. Again, the studio cited the same reason for the delay,
            saying they need more time to iron out the issues and fix the
            bugs.</p>
        <p>The final hitch came in October, where the studio once again took to
            Twitter to post what is now their infamous yellow text image to say
            that the game is being pushed back again to December 10. The delay
            was to further polish the game and work on the changes that would
            be going into the day 0 patch.</p>
        <p>The hype train, which was still going strong at this point despite
            all those setbacks, ended up derailing itself on launch day. Turns
            out, the game wasn't finished, wasn't polished, and the bugs
            certainly weren't ironed out. While the PC and Stadia versions
            were still playable despite the bugs, the PS4 and Xbox One consoles
            were also burdened by severe performance issues that rendered them
            largely unplayable unless you had the next-generation version of
            those consoles or particularly low standards.</p>
        <p>The reason for this preamble is that Cyberpunk 2077 is not your
            average game to review. Few games have received so much attention,
            curiosity, and interest before launch and managed to lose all of
            that in such a spectacular fashion immediately after launch. Other
            than the death threats, refunds, and negative reviews, the studio
            has also had to deal with Sony removing the game from its
            PlayStation store indefinitely along with multiple lawsuits.</p>
        <p>But underneath all the drama there is still a game to review, the
            one the developers had been working on for so many years and the
            one they wanted you to play. After 65 hours on the PC version,
            there certainly is a lot to talk about because, underneath all its
            issues, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that might be worth your time and
            patience after all.</p>
        <h2>Story and setting</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in a fictional place called Night City in
            California. The world in 2077 is ravaged nearly beyond repair by
            multiple wars and climate change. Fresh food and water are scarce,
            most wildlife has gone extinct, and humanity has taken to extreme
            body modifications to survive and adapt to rising local and cyber
            attacks.</p>
        <p>Night City is divided into multiple areas, each with a distinct
            look and identity. There are parts like Westbrook and City Center,
            where the rich and famous live and spend their money. The slightly
            less fortunate live in Watson and Heywood, places that still have
            that big city charm to them but where the streets aren't as shiny
            and the cars aren't as expensive. Those who are really down on
            their luck inhabit the streets of Santo Domingo or Pacifica whereas
            the deserts of Badlands have mostly been taken over by nomadic
            clans.</p>
        <p>Night City is home to all sorts of people, from billionaire CEOs of
            mega-corporations that essentially run the city to celebrities,
            violent criminals, skilled hackers known as netrunners,
            mercenaries, sex workers, drug dealers, and the homeless. The city
            also houses several gangs, many of whom have claimed a part of the
            city as their own and don't take kindly to outsiders.</p>
        <p>You play as V, a mercenary for hire. Whenever someone needs to get
            something or someone delivered, snatched, or just made to
            disappear, they call you. Depending upon the lifepath you choose in
            the game, V is either a corporate employee fallen from grace and
            trying to make their way back to the top (Corpo), someone who was
            raised on the streets of Night City and trying to rise up
            (Street Kid), or someone who once belonged to a gang of nomads but
            left wanting to become a big shot in the big city (Nomad).
            Regardless of how you start, your goal is the same, become a legend
            in Night City.</p>
        <p>Since this is a non-spoiler review, I'm not going to get into the
            events that happen in the game. All I'll say is that things don't
            quite go according to plan for V, which puts them on a path to set
            things right and thus we have a game on our hands.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed the main storyline in Cyberpunk 2077. Although
            parts of it are influenced by the choices you make, the overarching
            story largely remains the same and is entertaining regardless of
            how you choose to play it. It has its usual twists and turns but
            also has a fair bit of emotional depth and ends on a surprisingly
            poignant note that I wasn't expecting. It's something that sticks
            with you long after you've finished the game.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, the main story isn't actually very long and if you
            just focus on completing it then you will make your way to one of
            the game's multiple endings in about 20 hours or so. However, this
            is really not the best way to play the game and you would be
            missing out on so much the story has to offer, which really grows
            the more side-missions you do and get more side characters involved
            in your adventure. These people will later also influence the
            endings so make sure you take things slow, help others out, and not
            rush through the story.</p>
