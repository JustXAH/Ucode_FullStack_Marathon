            <td>The Soul Stone ranks as possibly the most dangerous of all the
                Infinity Stones, with it holding a special standing among the
                others. The sacrifices for the Stone are
                permanent and irreversible, as not even the omnipotent
                combination of the Six Stones could resurrect them. The Soul
                Stone has the ability to manipulate the soul, the essence that
                makes up an individual, and has the ability to resurrect and
                conjure the spiritual representation of the people who are
                dead.</td>

            <td>Green</td>
            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents, describes and governs
                over the flow of time, the Time Stone is among the most powerful
                artifacts in all existence. Due to its power, it cannot be
                held and used by anyone not powerful enough to withstand it,
                thus forcing Agamotto to create the Eye of Agamotto as a
                container to allow other sufficiently advanced sorcerers to
                wield it.</td>
            <td><img src="assets/images/time_stone.png" alt="TimeStone"

        <tr id="SpaceStone">
            <td>Space</td>
            <td>Blue</td>
            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over space,
                the Space Stone grants the wielder absolute control over space
                itself. It is primarily used to open portals to other locations
                and can even allow interdimensional travel. As one of the six
                Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks as among the most
                powerful artifacts in the universe, with Black Widow saying it
                has the power to wipe out an entire planet. Like with all other
                Infinity Stones, it can only be used safely by beings of
                sufficient power.</td>

            <td>Yellow</td>
            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs the fabric of
                mind, the Mind Stone grants whoever holds it complete control
                over the hearts and minds of others. Like with all the other
                Infinity Stones, it is among the most powerful artifacts in
                all existence.</td>
            <td><img src="assets/images/mind_stone.png" alt="MindStone"

            <td>Reality</td>
            <td>Red</td>
            <td>As the Infinity Stone that represented and governs over reality,
                the Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over reality
                itself. However, like all other Infinity Stones, due to it being
                the most powerful artifact in existence, it can only be wielded
                by beings of sufficient power and inside beings of no powers,
                it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced with Jane Foster.
                The Reality Stone's power is so great that it is capable of
                affecting reality on a universal scale, as Malekith would have
                been able to use the Stone to cover the whole universe in
                darkness.</td>

        <tr id="PowerStone">
            <td>Power</td>
            <td>Purple</td>
            <td>As the Infinity Stone that embodies both the sustaining and
                destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its
                wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the
                amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most
                destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw
                power. Like all Infinity Stones, the Power Stone is among the
                most powerful artifacts in the universe, with only beings of an
                extraordinary constitution being able to use it while less
                powerful beings would erupt in a violent explosion.</td>
