    <h1>Superhero trivia</h1>
    <h2 id="1">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
        them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
        superhero,
        <strong>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</strong>,
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a
        policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
        police story or detective story or human-interest story.
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
        becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a
        normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he
        becomes a superhero.</p>
